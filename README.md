Project 3: Exquisite Corps // Interaction II // Rob DePollo & Jimmy Newton // CCS Winter 2018

This project attempts to recontextualize the experience of birth, movement, creation, and death as an interactive experience. To communicate these concepts, we chose to depict these moments using the life cycle of a planet as a visual metaphor.
